# Greek Parsing Tool

This quiz-style web application allows students to practice determining the tense, voice, person, number, aspect, and gender of Greek verbs on sight.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Features
* **Random selection:** given words for each question are randomized to increase quiz effectiveness
* **Checking by attribute:** provides feedback on which answers are correct and incorrect
* **Simple UI:** easy to use dropdown selections for each attribute
* **Score tracking:** shows the user how many correct and incorrect to track progress


# Credit

Most files in this repository were provided by the template.
The files that I created are:
    dbConfig.js
    dbOperation.js

These files were provided but heavily modified, containing the main logic of the application:
    App.css
    App.js
    server.js

These files were provided and slightly modified for the implementation of the database:
    package.json

The rest of the files were provided and untouched from the template linked above.
