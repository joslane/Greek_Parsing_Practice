# Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Using this template proved incredibly useful in connecting the back end to the front end.
This simply required the large step of connecting the back end to the database and retrieving data from it.


# Provided Source Code

Most files in this repository were provided by the template.
The files that I created are:
    dbConfig.js
    dbOperation.js

These files were provided but heavily modified, containing the main logic of the program:
    App.css
    App.js
    server.js

These files were provided and slightly modified for the implementation of the database:
    package.json

The rest of the files were provided and untouched, some of which are
not necessary for this program to function. Others are highly necessary
but auto-generated and modified when built.

# Running the app

1) Open two terminal windows to the full-stack directory, wherever it is stored on the machine

2) Run "npm run server" to start the server

3) In the other window, run "npm start" which will pop out the site stored on the local host to the default browser
